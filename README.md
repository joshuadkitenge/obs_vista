# obs_vista
VISTA-specific (VIRCam) configuration and tasks for the LSST Data Management Stack

## Overview

This code is a modification of the obs_necam "Any cam" template; https://github.com/jrmullaney/obs_necam

The documenttation for this is at https://lsstcamdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html This documentation was developed during production of the obs package for the GOTO telescope.

As a first pass we have simply replaced Necam with VISTA throughout.

Folders:

- [camera]()
- [config]()
- [policy]()
- [python/lsst]()
- [ups]()

## TODO

1. Specify file naming scheme used in the raw VISTA databases.

2. Define VISTA filters.
