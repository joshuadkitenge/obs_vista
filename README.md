# obs_vista
VISTA-specific (VIRCam) configuration and tasks for the LSST Data Management Stack

## Overview

This code is a modification of the obs_necam "Any cam" template; https://github.com/jrmullaney/obs_necam

As a first pass we have simply replaced Necam with VISTA throughout.

## TODO

1. Specify file naming scheme used in the raw VISTA databases.

2. Define VISTA filters.
